I will refine the Editor UI and the global Logo as requested.

**1. Refactor Global Logo (`src/App.vue`)**
*   **Goal**: Replace the text-based "博" logo with a more aesthetic icon.
*   **Action**: Import the `Feather` icon from `lucide-vue-next` and replace the current square `div` logo with this icon.

**2. Refactor Editor Sidebar (`src/views/Editor.vue`)**
*   **Goal**: Change the sidebar from "completely hidden" to a "narrow icon bar" when collapsed.
*   **Action**:
    *   Modify the sidebar state logic to toggle between a wide width (`w-80`) and a narrow width (`w-16`).
    *   **Collapsed State (`w-16`)**: Show a vertical toolbar with a "Settings" icon button. Clicking it expands the sidebar.
    *   **Expanded State (`w-80`)**: Show the full settings panel (Filename input, etc.) with a "Collapse" button.
    *   Ensure smooth CSS transitions for the width change.
    *   Move the toggle button from the floating absolute position to inside the sidebar structure for better layout integration.

This will give the editor a more professional, IDE-like feel (similar to VS Code) and improve the overall visual quality with the new logo.
